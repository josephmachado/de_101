    "An additional benefit is that these tools allow the devs to define metrics in a way that enables end user to see the metrics under most conditions. For example if the end user filters the data by a specific country the metric will bereflected for the data post filter. While this may seound simple if you are using SQL, it is a lot of code. \n",

    "This is where BI tools shine are some even have their own scripting language (LOOKML, DAX, etc). **Note** that its best to keep your metric definition in your code repo when you can, as opposed to visualization tool. Having a single definition of metric will ensure  that any downstream consumer of our data (BI tool, dashboard, APIs, Data exports, etc) will have the same view of the data.                                                            \n",
