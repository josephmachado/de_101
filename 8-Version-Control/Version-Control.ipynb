    "2. Create a branch (an exact copy) of the `main` branch. A repo can have multiple branches, which are different versions of your repo. The `main` branch is often the version of code run in production. You'd create a branch with the checkout command as `git checkout -b your-branch-name`\n",
    "3. You'd make changes/add new feature to the code\n",
    "4. You'd stage the changed files with `git add your-files`\n",
    "5. Once staged you can \"commit\" the changes with `git commit -m commit-message` (you may need to resolve merge conflicts which arise when the lines of code you change/add are overlapping with some code which has been added to `main` branch since then)\n",
    "6. After committing your changes you can create a `pull request` by pushing you branch to the central git repo with `git push -f origin main`. \n",
    "7. In the central git repo UI (or via GitHub CLI) you can open a pull request for merging your branch with the `main` branch. A pull request is meant for review by your team mates. Most companies have standards for pull requests, such as detailed explanation, having >= 2 reviewers, automated testing when you create a PR, **CI**etc. \n",
    "8. Once you address all the (if any) comments from your colleagues you can merge your changes to the main branch.\n",
